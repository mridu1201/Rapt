"In every class, we make sure at least once to interact in pairs or in small groups.<br></br> These interactions begin with a reminder that every person in the room is a source of knowledge and end with a prompt for students to thank each other for sharing their insights."</i>

            <br></br>
        We put a lot of effort into developing relationships between students so we can provide meaningful advice. We get to know them as individuals, we learn about their needs, we understand their area of interest, we get to know what they are comfortable with so we can deliver it.
